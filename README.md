# Swarmbot

Swarmbot is the first implementation of the [Social Contract License](https://github.com/fractastical/distributed-governance/blob/master/social_contract_license.md)

Among other features, Swarmbot is a Hubot which allows you to create "bounties" and award them to people. It is nominally configured to run on Slack, but should work anywhere Hubot works, with minimal changes.
