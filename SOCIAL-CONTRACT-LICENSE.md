# Social contract license

The social contract license. To a certain extent, it is the direct descendent of the "social contract" philosophy that largely inspired the structure of the American Republic.

This codifies the statement of intent that is associated with the particular organization.

In this case the statement of intent is:

    ___________.

To enforce this statement of intent, we have a new legal construct called a "Distributed Collaborative Organization."  [https://www.scribd.com/doc/255347578/SWARM-Working-Paper-Distributed-Networks-and-the-Law] This consists of members who have agreed to the statement of intent. For financial or other types of contributions they may also receive some cryptoequity [http://p2pfoundation.net/Cryptoequity].

Delegates are elected by people who are members of the organization via a cryptoequity voting system. They serve as a "board" of the organization and take care of ordinary operational decisions.

This software may be freely used and modified by anyone consenting to this statement of intent so long as the license remains.

Delegates are required by the terms of this license to make an open record of the decision making related to any enforcement mechanism.

In the case, the governing body is:

    ___________.
