## NOTE

We are working on a Dynamic Equity Organization license to use for the Swarmbot Repository and in Swarmbot itself. If you are interested in contributing and receiving revenue distributions for your contributions get in touch. We are iterating on how the model will be structured and need your feedback.

Because legal documents are uh, legally binding we will using a simple copyright until the legal documents are appropriately finalized. You can see drafts of what we are working on prior to us adopting it here:
